<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

<!-- What have you learned/improved?-->

I learned much more about Flexbox than I ever did. I had always struggled to understand the concept, but for some reason while doing this project, it just clicked to me. Sure the alignments are probably off or I may have taken a few extra steps, but what matters is that it looks nearly identical. Meaning I am making progress.


- Your wisdom? :)

Persistence is the key to all.

### What I learned

I learned a great deal about Flexbox, better code prep and class names. More consistent and quicker lines of code.

### Useful resources

- VS Codes Copilot did aid me when I asked. When I would get stuck or frustrated from attempting so many times at the layout, then and only then did I ask.

### Built with

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.
